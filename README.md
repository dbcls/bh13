# BioHackathon 2013 repository aggregation

This repository serves as an archive for the [NBDC/DBCLS BioHackathon 2013](http://2013.biohackathon.org).
All relevant git repositories that are referenced in the hackathon proceedings are added here as
submodules and checked out to the nearest commit after the hackathon (or nearest coherent set of commits)
in order to reflect the state of the included repositories by the end of the event.

In addition, this repository has a [wiki](https://github.com/dbcls/bh13/wiki) used during the hackathon
(with some minor additions later on to add previously not included repositories).
